# Automatic Zip Folder Extractor

## Overview

This Python program automates the process of extracting contents from zip folders within the current directory. It searches for all zip files in the current directory, creates a folder with the same name as each zip file (excluding the '.zip' extension), and then extracts the contents of each zip file into its corresponding folder.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the **unzip.py** file.
3. Navigate to the folder containing your zip folders.
4. Paste the Python file in this folder.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
6. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python unzip.py
    ```

7. Sit back and relax as the program automatically extracts the contents of each zip folder into separate directories.

## Important Note

Make sure to run the command in the directory where the zip folders are located. The program will create a new folder for each zip file and extract its contents there.

Happy unzipping!
